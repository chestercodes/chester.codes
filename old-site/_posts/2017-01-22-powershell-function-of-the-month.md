I'm a big fan of powershell. Every now and then I write a function to help me in my day to day work.

I plan to write one of these every month and record them on this page.

[January - path environment variable display function](http://cburbidge.github.io/path-display-function/)

Hmm, bit of a jump here...

[April - local nuget cache deleting function](http://cburbidge.github.io/nuke-get/)
