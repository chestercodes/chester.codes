I'm lucky to say that my workhorse language is C#. 
I'm less lucky to say that the way that this blog currently colours the C# syntax isn't quite how i'm used to in visual studio.

I spent a bit of time trying to make the two colour sets align and [here are the results](https://github.com/CBurbidge/CBurbidge.github.io/blob/master/_sass/_highlights_csharp.scss)

In case this helps anyone in my position.
