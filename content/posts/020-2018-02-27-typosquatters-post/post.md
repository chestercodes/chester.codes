I'm excited to say that my blog post 'Hunting typosquatters on npm' was published on the [Scott Logic technical blog](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/02/27/hunting-typosquatters-on-npm.html).

This gives closure to a personal side project i've had for a few months and i'm glad that it didn't fall the way of too many side projects and was finally finished.
