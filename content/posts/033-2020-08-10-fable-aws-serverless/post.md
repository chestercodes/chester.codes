I've been using some (f)un-employment time to remind and upskill my knowledge of AWS. I've also wanted to try out the `serverless` framework to build apps using AWS Lambda functions with F# via fable.

I want to use fable to create AWS Lambdas that run the node.js runtime (rather than `dotnet`) to form the back-end of the application. The front-end application will also be written in F# and converted to a React.Js Javascript single page app.

## Err... what?

**AWS Lambda** [is a "functions as a service" technology](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) that makes it easy to build "serverless" applications. "serverless" applications have a lot of the deployment and running considerations abstracted away and are useful for apps that need to scale on demand and that may not be used often. 

AWS Lambda functions can be written in a variety of languages/runtimes including Java, Node.js, .Net Core and Python.

**The serverless framework** [is a set of tools](https://www.serverless.com/) that allow "serverless" applications to be developed and deployed easily. 

The main feature is the `serverless` cli which consumes YAML config files and can generate code to deploy applications and resources.


**fable** is [a compiler that can transpile F# code to Javascript](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable), which allows F# code to be run on the same platforms as Javascript code. 

fable works at the language level and passes the F# abstract syntax tree to the [babel](https://babeljs.io/) compiler which can output Javascript.

---

## Err... why?

There are a few advantages of trying this approach:

**cost** - serverless applications don't have some of the same up front costs as other methods of deploying apps using a "best-practice" approach. A zero-to-low traffic serverless app will likely fall into the free-tier for most cloud provider services.


**client-server code sharing** - fable allows the same strongly typed code to be run on the back-end and front-end. This is currently possible with typescript, but i'm a bigger fan of the F# type-system. 

This means that dtos, validation logic and domain types can be shared, this potentially removes some kinds of bugs and can help speed up development time. 

**Runtime** - Targeting the node.js runtime allows access to a formidable amount of third-party libraries on the `npm` repository. This is especially useful for AWS libraries where the .Net client libraries can lag behind the node.js version in terms of maturity.

Another big advantage is that [the "cold start" time for node.js is lower](https://mikhail.io/serverless/coldstarts/aws/) than for `dotnet`. It's not a huge difference, but these start times can compound if there is a chain of lambda calls.

---

## Architecture

The app consists of a static SPA site stored on AWS S3, that is hosted with the AWS Cloudfront CDN. 

The back-end consists of a collection of AWS Lambda functions that form a REST API with the addition of an AWS API Gateway. 
The application sends requests to the gateway by customising the CDN's behaviour to direct calls to the `<CDNBase>/api/<path>` to the gateway.

## Api

### Shared code

A big advantage as described above is the possibility to share code across the front and backend code bases. In this case a file called `Shared.fs` is used in both and it contains a couple of DTOs to create and receive a customer:

``` fsharp
module Shared

module Dtos =    
    type CustomerCreate = { Name: string; Age: int; }
    type Customer =       { Name: string; Age: int; Id: int; }
```

### Functions

The Api consists of two AWS Lambda functions, `customerGet` and `customerPost`, written in F# and transpiled to Javascript.

Functions invoked by AWS Lambda need to have two arguments, these are often called  `event` and `context`.

`event` - contains information about the trigger of the function, in this case data relating to the API Gateway and REST call details. 

`context` - contains information on the context of the call, which includes AWS specific information like resource and user identifiers. Context also provides the methods required to respond to the request call. API Gateway expects an object that contains information on the response `statusCode`, `headers` and `body` to be passed to the `context.succeed` method.

The `event` and `context` objects need type definitions to be used with fable. These can be derived by deploying empty functions and using `console.log` to work out the property names and types. In the solution these types form an `AwsTypes` module.

Helper functions to create common responses with API Gateway can be defined:

``` fsharp
open Fable.Core.JsInterop
open Fable.Core.JS
open AwsTypes

let apiGatewayResponse code body =
    {
        isBase64Encoded = false
        statusCode = code
        headers = createEmpty
        body = JSON.stringify body
    }

let ok body = apiGatewayResponse 200 body
let notFound = apiGatewayResponse 404 ""
let badRequest body = apiGatewayResponse 400 body
```

This allows creation of the responses `ok`, `notFound` and `badRequest` with the appropriate status codes and arguments for `body` where appropriate.

The `customerPost` function shows an implementation of a `POST` method as a Lambda function. The required arguments are shown with the types `ApiGatewayEvent` and `AwsLambdaContext`. 

The `event.body` contains the string representation of the request body of type `CustomerCreate` which can be deserialised using the `tryParseAs` method from the `Fable.SimpleJson` library. 
If the object can be parsed then the function returns a `Customer` with an `ok` response, otherwise it creates a `badRequest` with the error. The response needs to be passed to `context.succeed` for API Gateway to return the response to the front-end app.

``` fsharp
open Fable.SimpleJson
open Shared.Dtos

let customerPost ((event: ApiGatewayEvent), (context: AwsLambdaContext)) =
    match event.body |> Json.tryParseAs<CustomerCreate> with
    | Ok dto -> 
        // act as if this is saved somewhere and return a Customer.
        ok { Id = 234; Name = dto.Name; Age = dto.Age; }
    | Error error -> badRequest error
    |> context.succeed
```

The `customerGet` function implements a service to find and return customers. The function retrieves the `id` from the `event.pathParameters` object and either returns the `Customer` in an `ok` (if the Id is 123) or returns a `notFound` response.

``` fsharp
open Fable.Core.DynamicExtensions

let getId pathParameters = pathParameters.["id"].ToString()

let tryFindCustomer id =
    // pretending as if this is retrieving from a database or similar
    match id with
    | "123" -> Some { Id = 123; Name = "John"; Age = 30; }
    | _ -> None

let tryGetCustomer = getId >> tryFindCustomer
    
let customerGet ((event: ApiGatewayEvent), (context: AwsLambdaContext)) =    
    match tryGetCustomer event.pathParameters with
    | Some customer -> ok customer
    | None          -> notFound
    |> context.succeed
```

### Fable config

`fable` is called and configured using `webpack`. The webpack build needs some `fable` and `babel` related npm packages to run which can be restored from a package.json file.

The `.fs` files that contain the above code are specified in a `Services.fsproj` project file, along with the nuget dependencies. 

Fable works at the language level and loads code from the project file and all of the libraries into an AST. It then converts this to one that babel can use and outputs this as Javascript.

The webpack config file is quite involved and can be seen at the project [code repo](https://github.com/chestercodes/fable-aws-serverless/blob/master/src/services/webpack.config.js). A notable part of the config are the `entry` and `output` nodes which detail the `.fsproj` file and the desired bundle output:

``` js
  entry: './src/Services.fsproj',
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, "./"),
    filename: 'deploy.js',
    library:"services",
    libraryTarget: 'commonjs'
  },
```

The config tells webpack that the files in the `./src/Services.fsproj` file need to be compiled as a `commonjs` module called `services` into a file called `deploy.js` in the working directory.

The bundle can be produced by running webpack, this is commonly included as the `build` script in a `package.json` file so that it can be called with `npm run build`:

## Api - deployment


The `serverless` framework is used to develop and deploy the back-end code. Functions and resources are defined using an infrastructure-as-code approach in a file called `serverless.yml`. 

The Api for this project is going to be referred to as `services`, will run the latest version of `node.js` and will be deployed to AWS's `eu-west-1` region so the file starts with:

``` yaml
service: services

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs12.x
  stage: api
  region: eu-west-1
```

The `stage: api` is a bit of a hack to ensure that the url paths start with `/api/` as the serverless aws plugin automatically creates the infrastructure this way.

The api is going to consist of a `GET /customer/{id}` and a `POST /customer`. These will invoke two Javascript functions located in a `services` module, that are minified into a `deploy.js` file that `serverless` will wrap up into a .zip file. 

The api paths and deployment are configured in the `serverless.yml` file:

``` yaml
package:
  exclude:
    - ./**
  include:
    - deploy.js

functions:
  customerPost:
    #   (deploy.js).<module>.<exportedJsMethod>
    handler: deploy.services.customerPost
    events:
      - http:
          path: customer
          method: post

  customerGet:
    handler: deploy.services.customerGet
    events:
      - http:
          path: customer/{id}
          method: get
```

The `package` specifies what is to be included in the .zip file using glob patterns. In this case it ignores everything apart from the `deploy.js` file.

The `functions` node defines the lambda functions to be deployed. Each named function node specifies the path of the javascript function that handles the call and the events they are invoked by. 
The `handler` specifies the exported Javascript function to be invoked with `<fileName>.<moduleName>.<functionName>`.

The functions config is designed to be abstractable across different cloud providers and in this case the `http` node sets up an `API Gateway` deployment with the specified `path` and `method`.

### Deployment

Once the code has been built into a `deploy.js` file and the `serverless` cli is [configured with the appropriate AWS account](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials#using-aws-profiles), then the api is ready to be deployed. 
The `serverless` cli makes this a simple task of running the command 

``` bash
serverless deploy
```

This will create the required .zip file and cloudformation templates into a `.serverless` folder and create the resources with cloudformation. It then uploads the zip file to S3 where it can be deployed from and returns the urls that can be used to call the Lambdas from API Gateway.

![DeployApi](DeployApi.jpg)

The urls of the deployed functions are listed and these can be used to find the host of the API Gateway.
Here the host is `9nfublf0dj.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`, this will be used as a source for the Cloudfront CDN.

---

## Site

With the api up and running the site can be created. The site is the `Feliz` `dotnet` [template](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Feliz.Template/) with enough functionality to make the two requests. The site is built using webpack as above and builds to a `deploy` folder, which will be uploaded to S3.


Only the site deployment is going to be described, but for those who might not have seen an elmish app before, the code is nice and can be [seen here](https://github.com/chestercodes/fable-aws-serverless/blob/master/src/site/src/App.fs). Again it is worth pointing out the benefits of the code sharing across the client and server. 


The site deployment config is specified in another `serverless.yml` file in the site code base. The file specifies the cloud provider to use and some custom variables including the api endpoint and `api` url part, and an S3 bucket name to use.

``` yaml
service: site

custom:
  s3Bucket: fable-aws-serverless-site-chestercodes
  apiEndpointHost: 9nfublf0dj.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
  servicesStage: api

provider:
  name: aws
  region: eu-west-1
```

The config file then just needs to create some resources in a `resources` node. The `Resources` node within contains yaml that is mostly the same as AWS Cloudformation yaml but has slightly different special operator keywords. 

The first thing to create is an S3 bucket to contain the contents of the `deploy` folder. The yaml below shows this with the name substituted with the `s3Bucket` from the custom variables.


``` yaml
resources:
  Resources:
    WebAppS3Bucket:
      Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
      Properties:
        BucketName: ${self:custom.s3Bucket}
        AccessControl: PublicRead
```

For security it's best practice to limit the access of the S3 bucket to just the AWS Cloudfront instance. This requires a `AWS::CloudFront::CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity` and bucket policy that links the bucket resource to the identity with the permission to read the contents:

```yaml
    WebAppS3BucketPolicy:
      Type: 'AWS::S3::BucketPolicy'
      Properties:
        Bucket:
          Ref: WebAppS3Bucket
        PolicyDocument:
          Statement:
            - Action:
                - 's3:GetObject'
              Effect: 'Allow'
              Principal:
                CanonicalUser: !GetAtt CfOriginAccessIdentity.S3CanonicalUserId
              Resource: arn:aws:s3:::${self:custom.s3Bucket}/*

    CfOriginAccessIdentity:
      Type: "AWS::CloudFront::CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity"
      Properties:
        CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig:
          Comment: 'Access S3 bucket content only through CloudFront'
```

The last step is to define the cloudfront instance. This is quite involved but starts by specifying:

``` yaml
    WebAppCloudFrontDistribution:
      Type: AWS::CloudFront::Distribution
      Properties:
        DistributionConfig:
          Enabled: 'true'
          DefaultRootObject: index.html
          CustomErrorResponses:
            - ErrorCode: 404
              ResponseCode: 200
              ResponsePagePath: /index.html
```

This states that we want a cloudfront distribution that is enabled, has a default page of `index.html` and redirects missing pages to the default one. 

Still within the `DistributionConfig` we define the sources of information that the CDN uses:

``` yaml
          Origins:
          - Id: WebApp
            DomainName: ${self:custom.s3Bucket}.s3.amazonaws.com
            S3OriginConfig:
              OriginAccessIdentity:
                !Join
                  - ''
                  - - 'origin-access-identity/cloudfront/'
                    - Ref: CfOriginAccessIdentity
          - Id: WebApi
            DomainName: ${self:custom.apiEndpointHost}
            CustomOriginConfig:
              HTTPPort: 80
              HTTPSPort: 443
              OriginProtocolPolicy: https-only
```

This defines two sources `ẀebApp` and `WebApi` which are configured to the S3 bucket and the `apiEndpointHost` where the API Gateway is hosted.

Then need to define the CDN behaviours. The `DefaultCacheBehavior` is used to respond with the static site files. The static files are loaded from S3 and this link is established by specifying the `TargetOriginId` of `WebApp`.
The required behaviour will be specific to the app, here i've chosen to restrict the `AllowedMethods` to `GET` and `HEAD`, remove the cookies and forward the query string. 

The first of the `CacheBehaviors` takes preference over the default and specifies requests that include the `/${self:custom.servicesStage}/` (in this case `/api/`) url part. It directs request to the `WebApi` target with no restricted request methods or caching.

``` yaml
          DefaultCacheBehavior:
            AllowedMethods:
              - GET
              - HEAD
            ForwardedValues:
              QueryString: 'true'
              Cookies:
                Forward: none
            TargetOriginId: WebApp
            ViewerProtocolPolicy: redirect-to-https
          CacheBehaviors:
            - AllowedMethods:
                - DELETE
                - GET
                - HEAD
                - OPTIONS
                - PATCH
                - POST
                - PUT
              TargetOriginId: WebApi
              PathPattern: /${self:custom.servicesStage}/*
              DefaultTTL: 0
              MinTTL: 0
              MaxTTL: 0
              ForwardedValues:
                QueryString: 'true'
                Headers:
                - Accept
                - Referer
                - Authorization
                - Content-Type
              ViewerProtocolPolicy: https-only

```

The site can be deployed with the command `serverless deploy` and when the cloudformation template is deployed the created cloudfront resource can be seen:


![CloudfrontPanel](CloudfrontPanel.jpg)

The domain name is listed on the cloudfront panel, here highlighted in yellow, and a custom domain can easily be added using Route 53 and AWS Certificate manager.

Once the `deploy` folder contents have been uploaded to the S3 bucket and the cloudfront instance has had about an hour to recognise the bucket then the site can be seen. 

![Site](Site.jpg)

Here the contents of the `customerGet` call has been rendered onto the page.

## Conclusion

The steps above detail how to create a "serverless" app on AWS using F#, fable and the `serverless` framework. 

The documentation for some of the above was a bit sparse and then configuration of cloudfront was a bit frustrating at times. But overall I think that this is a good approach for certain kinds of application.

The code is on [my github for those interested](https://github.com/chestercodes/fable-aws-serverless) :)
